# What the function is this?

Stargazers is a module of stuff that I frequently find myself repackaging and using for the same personal projects. Now instead of writing the code again, I just put it in Stargazers.

Eventually I decided I conceded to the vague notion of "doing this right", repackaged it all as a poetry project, annotated almost every single bit of code, and decided to open source it.

I attempted to most of the swearing and some of the snark during this refactor. I will not remove all of it.

There are some mildly interesting batch scripts in... `\scripts` as well that I use during hobbyist development.
